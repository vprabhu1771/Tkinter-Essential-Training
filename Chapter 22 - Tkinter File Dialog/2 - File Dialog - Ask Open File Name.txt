Here's a full example of using filedialog.askopenfilename to open a file in tkinter:

In this example, we define a function open_file that opens a file using filedialog.askopenfilename. When the function is called, it creates a Tk object and hides the main window using the withdraw method. It then calls askopenfilename to display the file dialog box and get the selected file path. Finally, it opens the selected file and displays its contents.

We create a button in the main window that calls the open_file function when clicked. When the button is clicked, it opens the file dialog box and allows the user to select a file to open. Once a file is selected, the open_file function is called and the file is opened and displayed.
