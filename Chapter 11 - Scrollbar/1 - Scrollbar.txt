here's a full example of how to create and use a Scrollbar widget in Tkinter:

import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

# Adjust Size
root.geometry("300x200")

# create a Text widget and add some text
text = tk.Text(root)
text.insert(tk.END, "This is some long text that requires scrolling.\n" * 10)

# create a Scrollbar widget and link it to the Text widget
scrollbar = tk.Scrollbar(root)
scrollbar.pack(side=tk.RIGHT, fill=tk.Y)
text.config(yscrollcommand=scrollbar.set)
scrollbar.config(command=text.yview)

# add the Text widget to the window
text.pack(side=tk.LEFT, fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)

root.mainloop()



In this example, we create a Text widget and add some long text to it using the insert() method. We then create a Scrollbar widget and pack it on the right side of the window using the pack() method. We link the Scrollbar to the Text widget using the yscrollcommand and config() methods, and set the command for the Scrollbar using the command method.

Finally, we pack the Text widget on the left side of the window, and set its side, fill, and expand options to fill the available space and allow scrolling as needed.

You can customize this example by replacing the Text widget with another widget that requires scrolling, or by changing the orientation or appearance of the Scrollbar.
