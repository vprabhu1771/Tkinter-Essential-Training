The Label widget in Tkinter is used to display text or an image on the screen. It is a simple widget that can be customized in many ways to display various types of content.

To create a Label widget, you first need to create a parent widget to contain it, such as a Tk or Frame widget. You can then create the Label widget and set its text or image using the text or image options.

Here is an example of creating a Label widget with some text:


import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

# Adjust size
root.geometry("400x100")

label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, world!")
label.pack()

root.mainloop()


In this example, we create a Label widget with the text "Hello, world!" and add it to the main application window (root) using the pack method.

You can customize the appearance of the Label widget in many ways, such as changing the font, color, and alignment of the text, or adding a border or background color to the widget. You can also use images instead of text by setting the image option to a PhotoImage object.

Here is an example of creating a Label widget with an image:


import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

# Adjust size
root.geometry("400x400")

photo = tk.PhotoImage(file="image.gif")
label = tk.Label(root, image=photo)
label.pack()

root.mainloop()

In this example, we create a PhotoImage object from a file, and then use it to set the image option of the Label widget. This displays the image in the window.
