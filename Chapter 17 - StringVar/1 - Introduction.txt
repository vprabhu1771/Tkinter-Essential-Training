we create a StringVar named label_text to hold the text of the label. We set its initial value to "Hello, World!". We then create a label widget and associate it with the label_text variable using the textvariable option. This means that whenever the value of label_text changes, the label will automatically update to display the new value.

We also create an Entry widget and a Button widget. When the user types a new value into the Entry widget and clicks the Button, the update_label function is called. This function updates the value of label_text to the value of the Entry widget, which causes the label to update with the new text.

Overall, this example demonstrates how you can use Tkinter variables to control the state of your GUI components and make them interactive.
