The provided code is an example of how to resize an image using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) module. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Import the `Image` class from the `PIL` module:

from PIL import Image


2. Open an image by providing the path to the image file:

image = Image.open('path/to/image.jpg')

Replace 'path/to/image.jpg' with the actual path to your image file.

3. Define the desired width and height for the resized image:

width = 100
height = 100

Here, `width` and `height` are set to 100 pixels each, but you can adjust these values according to your specific requirements.

4. Resize the image by calling the `resize()` method on the `image` object, passing the desired width and height as a tuple:

resized_image = image.resize((width, height))

The `resize()` method returns a new `Image` object with the specified dimensions.

5. Save the resized image to a file by calling the `save()` method on the `resized_image` object, providing the desired output file path:

resized_image.save('path/to/resized_image.jpg')

Replace `'path/to/resized_image.jpg'` with the actual path and file name where you want to save the resized image.

After executing the code, the original image will be resized to the specified dimensions, and the resized image will be saved to the specified output file path.

Make sure to have the PIL library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

pip install pillow
