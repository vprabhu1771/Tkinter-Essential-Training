The Python Pillow library (also known as PIL or Pillow) is a powerful image processing library that allows you to manipulate and enhance images using Python. It provides a wide range of image processing capabilities, including image loading and saving, resizing, cropping, rotating, applying filters, adding text and shapes, and much more.

To get started with Pillow, you need to install it. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

pip install pillow

Once Pillow is installed, you can import it into your Python script using the following import statement:

from PIL import Image
