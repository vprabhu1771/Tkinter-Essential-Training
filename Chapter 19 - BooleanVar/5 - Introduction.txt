In this example, we create three BooleanVar objects named math_var, science_var, and english_var. These variables will hold the values of the checkboxes for each course.

We define a print_selection function that checks the values of the BooleanVars and prints the names of the selected courses. If no courses are selected, it prints a message saying so.

We create three Checkbutton widgets, one for each course, and associate each one with a BooleanVar. We pack these checkbuttons into the root window.

We also create a Button widget that is associated with the print_selection function. When the user clicks the button, the selected courses are printed to the console.

The user can select any combination of courses by checking the corresponding checkboxes. When the button is clicked, the selected courses are printed to the console.
