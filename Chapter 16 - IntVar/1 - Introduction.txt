In this example, we create two IntVar objects named gender_var. The value of gender_var is set to 1, which means that the "Male" radiobutton is initially selected. We then create two radiobuttons and associate them with the gender_var variable using the variable option and the value option. This means that when the user selects a radiobutton, the value of gender_var will be updated to reflect the selected gender.

We also create a button widget and define a display_gender function that displays the selected gender in the console. The display_gender function checks the value of gender_var and prints the appropriate message.

Finally, we associate the display_gender function with the button using the command option. When the user clicks the button, the display_gender function is called, which displays the selected gender in the console.

Overall, this example demonstrates how you can use IntVar objects to represent gender options with radiobuttons in Tkinter, and how you can associate a function with a button to respond to user input.
