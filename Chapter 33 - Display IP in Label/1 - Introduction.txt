To retrieve the IP address from a third-party website and display it in a Tkinter label, you can use the `requests` library to make an HTTP request to a website that displays your IP address. Here's an example:


In this example, we define a `get_ip_address` function that makes an HTTP request to the `https://api.ipify.org/?format=json` URL. This URL returns a JSON response containing your IP address. We extract the IP address from the JSON response and return it. We create a Tkinter window using `tk.Tk()`. We create a label (`ip_label`) with the text "IP Address: " and another label (`ip_value_label`) that will display the actual IP address. The initial IP address is obtained by calling the `get_ip_address` function, and the label's text is set to that value. Finally, we enter the Tkinter event loop with `root.mainloop()`, which will display the window and update the IP address if it changes.
